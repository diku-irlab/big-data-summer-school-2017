Download and open the `readme.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for more information. 

To open the notebook, you need to use a Jupyter notebook server by running the following from the commandline,
`jupyter-notebook`. Make sure that you execute this command while in the same directory you downloaded the notebook to.

Next your default browser should open and you should be able to click on the readme notebook.
